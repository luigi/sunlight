h2. Description

A little gem that integrates with the Sunlight Labs API. From the "official site":http://services.sunlightlabs.com/api/:

bq. The Sunlight Labs API provides methods for obtaining basic information on Members of Congress, legislator IDs used by various websites, and lookups between places and the politicians that represent them. The primary purpose of the API is to facilitate mashups involving politicians and the various other APIs that are out there.

Full API documentation available "here":http://services.sunlightlabs.com/api/docs/. 

Also, the Sunlight gem integrates with the Google Maps API for "street address geocoding":http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/services.html#Geocoding. Because some zip codes overlap two or more congressional districts, passing in a latitude/longitude will give users the most accurate information. Since it's highly unlikely a user would know their exact lat/long, the Google Maps API is used to translate a street address string into a lat/long pair.


h2. Installation

The following gems are required:

* json
* ym4r

@$ sudo gem install json ym4r@

Then, install the stable Sunlight gem:

@$ sudo gem install sunlight@

Or, if you're adventurous, the latest dev version (which should be quite stable):

@$ sudo gem install luigi-sunlight --source=http://gems.github.com@



h2. Set Up

First, register for an API key "here":http://services.sunlightlabs.com/api/register/. 

Then, you'll want to stick the following lines somewhere in your Ruby environment. _Note, this set up changed slightly as of version 0.9.0:_

<pre><code>
	require 'rubygems'
	require 'sunlight'
	Sunlight::Base.api_key = 'yourapikeyfromtheurlabove'
</code></pre>

If you're testing this out in IRB, you'll run them one at a time. If you're using Rails >=2.1, stick them in a file called @sunlight.rb@ in @RAILS_ROOT/config/initializers@. They'll load on app startup.

h2. Usage

The Sunlight gem currently supports the Legislator and District objects. The Lobbyist object is coming soon.

h3. Legislator

Time to get to the good stuff. The most useful method is @Legislator#all_for@:

<pre><code>
	congresspeople = Sunlight::Legislator.all_for(:address => "123 Fifth Ave New York, NY 10003")
	senior_senator = congresspeople[:senior_senator]
	junior_senator = congresspeople[:junior_senator]
	representative = congresspeople[:representative]

	junior_senator.firstname          # returns "Kirsten" 
	junior_senator.lastname           # returns "Gillibrand"   
	junior_senator.congress_office    # returns "531 Dirksen Senate Office Building"
	junior_senator.phone              # returns "202-224-4451"  
</code></pre>

Note that you should make the best attempt to get a full street address, as that is geocoded behind the scenes into a lat/long pair. If all you have is a five-digit zip code, you should not use @Legislator#all_for@, instead opting for @Legislator#all_in_zipcode@ (see below). If you pass in a zip+4, then go ahead and use @Legislator#all_for@.

So @Legislator#all_for@ returns a hash of @Legislator@ objects, and the keys are @:senior_senator@, @:junior_senator@, and @:representative@. Make sure to review all the available fields from the "Sunlight Labs API":http://services.sunlightlabs.com/api/docs/legislators/. You can also pass in a lat/long pair:

<pre><code>
	congresspeople = Sunlight::Legislator.all_for(:latitude => 33.876145, :longitude => -84.453789)
</code></pre>

This bypasses the geocoding necessary by the Google Maps API. For social networks and other applications with a User object, it makes sense to geocode the user's address up front and save the lat/long data in the local database. Then, use the lat/long pair instead of address, which cuts a substantial bit of time from the @Legislator#all_for@ request since the Google Maps API Geocoding function doesn't have to be called.

Have a five-digit zip code only? You can use the @Legislator#all_in_zipcode@ method, but keep in mind that a single zip may have multiple U.S. Representatives, as congressional district lines frequently divide populous zip codes. Unlike @Legislator#all_for@, this method returns an array of legislators, and it'll be up to you to parse through them (there will be a senior senator, a junior senator, and one or more representatives).

<pre><code>
	members_of_congress = Sunlight::Legislator.all_in_zipcode(90210)

	members_of_congress.each do |member|
		# do stuff
	end
</code></pre>

You can also use the @Legislator#all_where@ method for searching based on available fields. Again, you'll get back an array of @Legislator@ objects:

<pre><code>
	johns = Sunlight::Legislator.all_where(:firstname => "John")
	floridians = Sunlight::Legislator.all_where(:state => "FL")
	dudes = Sunlight::Legislator.all_where(:gender => "M")

	johns.each do |john|
	  # do stuff
	end
</code></pre>

Lastly, to provide your users with a name search functionality, use @Legislator#search_by_name@, which uses fuzzy matching to compensate for nicknames and misspellings. So "Teddy Kennedey" (real name Edward Kennedy) and "Jack Murtha" (real name John Murtha) will return the correct matches. You can specify a higher confidence threshold (default set to 0.80) if you feel that the matches being returned aren't accurate enough. This also returns an array of @Legislator@ objects:

<pre><code>
	legislators = Sunlight::Legislator.search_by_name("Teddy Kennedey")
	legislators = Sunlight::Legislator.search_by_name("Johnny Boy Kerry", 0.91)
</code></pre>


h3. District

There's also the @District@ object. @District#get@ takes in either lat/long or an address and does it's best to return the correct Congressional District:

<pre><code>
	district = Sunlight::District.get(:latitude => 33.876145, :longitude => -84.453789)
	district.state            # returns "GA"
	district.number           # returns "6"

	district = Sunlight::District.get(:address => "123 Fifth Ave New York, NY") 
</code></pre>

Finally, two more methods, @District.all_from_zipcode@ and @District.zipcodes_in@, help you out when you want to get all districts in a given zip code, or if you want to get back all zip codes in a given district.

<pre><code>
	districts = Sunlight::District.all_from_zipcode(90210)    # returns array of District objects
	zipcodes = Sunlight::District.zipcodes_in("NY", "10")     # returns array of zip codes as strings  ["11201", "11202", "11203",...]
</code></pre>


h3. Committees

Members of Congress sit on all-important @Committees@, the smaller bodies that hold hearings and are first to review legislation.

The @Committee@ object has three identifying fields, and an array of subcommittees, which are @Committee@ objects themselves. To get all the committees for a given chamber of Congress:

<pre><code>
  committees = Sunlight::Committee.all_for_chamber("Senate") # or "House" or "Joint"
  some_committee = committees.last
  some_committee.name       # "Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry"
  some_committee.id         # "SSAF"
  some_committee.chamber    # "Senate"
  
  some_committee.subcommittees.each do |subcommittee|
    # do some stuff...
  end
</code></pre>

The @Committee@ object also keeps a collection of members in that committee, but since that's an API-heavy call, it must be done for each Committee one at a time:

<pre><code>
  committees = Sunlight::Committee.all_for_chamber("Senate") # or "House" or "Joint"
  some_committee = committees.last    # some_committee.members starts out as nil
  some_committee.load_members         # some_committee.members is now populated
  some_committee.members.each do |legislator|
    # do some stuff...
  end
</code></pre>

Coming from the opposite direction, the @Legislator@ object has a method for getting all committees for that particular Legislator, returning an array of @Committee@ objects:

<pre><code>
  legislators = Sunlight::Legislator.search_by_name("Ted Kennedy")
  legislator = legislators.first
  legislator.committees.each do |committee|
    # do some stuff...
  end
</code></pre>

h3. Lobbyists and Filings

Moving away from members of Congress, the Sunlight API also exposes data on @Lobbyists@, the organizations and companies they lobby on behalf of, and the @Issues@ they lobby on. Lobbyists must submit filings to the Senate Office of Public Records, and these are represented as @Filings@ in the API.

Like on the @Legislator@ object, the @Lobbyist@ object provides for fuzzy name search capability. However, because the universe of Lobbyists is much larger than Legislators, the confidence threshold defaults to 0.90 instead of 0.80, and also limits the search to Lobbyists who have filed in the current year. Both can be adjusted, and the method returns an array of @Lobbyist@ objects:

<pre><code>
	lobbyists = Lobbyist.search("Nisha Thompsen")
	lobbyists = Lobbyist.search("Michael Klein", 0.95, 2007)	
</code></pre>

You can also use the @Filing@ object to get a specific filing record, where the unique identifier comes from the "Senate Office of Public Records":http://senate.gov/legislative/Public_Disclosure/LDA_reports.htm. The @Filing@ object will have an array of issues and lobbyists associated to it.

<pre><code>
	filing = Sunlight::Filing.get("29D4D19E-CB7D-46D2-99F0-27FF15901A4C")
	filing.issues.each { |issue| ... }
	filing.lobbyists.each { |lobbyist| ... }
</code></pre>

If you have a client name (that is, the organization or company the lobbyist works for) or the registrant name (the lobbyist), then you can also find associated filings. To use the @all_where@ method, pass in a hash with @:client_name@, @:registrant_name@, and @:year@ as the keys. You must pass in @:client_name@ or @:registrant_name@. 

<pre><code>
	filings = Filing.all_where(:client_name => "SUNLIGHT FOUNDATION")
	filings.each do |filing|
	  ...
	  filing.issues.each { |issue| ... }
	  filing.lobbyists.each { |issue| ... }    
	end
</code></pre>
